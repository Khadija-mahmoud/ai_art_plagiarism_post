# Solving the Image Resizing Challenge 📷

In the world of blogging, image sizing can be a hassle. This documentation explores automated solutions to tackle the challenge of resizing images within Markdown files. Discover the journey, possible solutions, and the journey of trial and error.

## Introduction 📖

Blogging is an art form, but image resizing can disrupt the creative flow. This documentation delves into the problem of image sizing in Markdown files and presents two possible solutions.

## The Image Sizing Challenge 🖼️

### Manual Image Adjustments 🖱️

Manually adjusting image sizes is time-consuming and error-prone. An automation solution is needed to enhance the blogging experience.

### The Need for Automation ⚙️

Automating image resizing would save time and ensure images fit seamlessly within blog content.

## Possible Solutions

### Solution 1: Modifying Image Tags in Markdown 🏞️

#### Function: `modify_image_tags_in_markdown`

```python
def modify_image_tags_in_markdown(input_md_file, output_md_file, desired_width=600):
    # Code for modifying image tags...
    # ...
```

Automate image resizing by modifying image tags within Markdown files, preserving aspect ratios.

### Solution 2: Resizing Images Programmatically 🧑‍💻

#### Function: `resize_images_in_markdown`

```python
def resize_images_in_markdown(input_md_file, output_md_file, img_width=600):
    # Code for resizing images...
    # ...
```

Automate image resizing by programmatically resizing images and updating image links in Markdown.
