# Problem and Context of My Automation 🤖

## Introduction 📖

Blogging is an art form in itself, a creative process of sharing thoughts and ideas with the world. Recently, I embarked on a journey to explore a topic that has captivated my interest: plagiarism in AI-generated art. This exploration led me to a multi-part blog series, where I aimed to delve into the complex relationship between AI-generated art and its traditional counterparts. However, as I delved deeper into this fascinating subject, I encountered a recurring challenge that disrupted my creative flow: image resizing. In this GitHub Pages-style documentation, I'll take you through the problem I faced and the journey to automate the solution. 🚀

## The Image Resizing Challenge 🖼️

### Manual Image Adjustments 🖱️

Every time I added an image to complement my blog posts, I found myself engaged in a tedious task: manually adjusting the image size. This process not only consumed precious time but also disrupted the seamless flow of my blogging experience. It became increasingly clear that a more efficient solution was needed to enhance my productivity and creativity. 

### The Need for Automation ⚙️

Frustrated by the manual resizing process, I sought a technological solution. My goal was to create a code that could automatically adjust the size of every image while preserving its aspect ratio. This automation would not only save time but also allow me to focus on crafting high-quality content for my blog.

## The Journey to Automation 🛠️

### Exploring Code Solutions 🧰

My journey began by exploring various code-based solutions to the image resizing challenge. One of my initial attempts involved accessing the source code of the images themselves. I experimented with Python libraries and web scraping techniques to programmatically resize the images. While this approach had some success, it was far from ideal and required a significant amount of manual intervention.

### Modifying Markdown Files 📝

Undeterred by the initial challenges, I shifted my focus to a more direct and efficient solution. I realized that since my blog posts were primarily in Markdown format, I could modify the image tags directly within the Markdown files. This approach presented the advantage of maintaining a clean and organized structure for my blog.

### Python Scripting 🐍

My revised strategy involved creating a Python script that would parse my Markdown files, identify image tags, and adjust the image dimensions within those tags. The key challenge was to ensure that the aspect ratio of the images remained intact, preventing distortion or loss of image quality.

### Automating Markdown Adjustments 🚀

As I delved into coding this solution, I faced several iterations and refinements. Initially, I designed the script to generate a new Markdown file as the output, leaving the original Markdown untouched. However, I soon realized that this created unnecessary redundancy and complexity.

To streamline the process further, I modified the script to overwrite the existing Markdown files with the adjusted image tags. This change ensured that the input Markdown file was equivalent to the output Markdown file, eliminating the need for additional file management.

## Conclusion 🎉

In conclusion, my exploration of plagiarism in AI-generated art led me to discover a valuable lesson in problem-solving through code. The journey from manually adjusting image sizes to developing an automated solution highlighted the potential for technology to streamline creative endeavors. It reinforced the notion that with the right tools and a bit of coding, we can overcome challenges and make our blogging experiences more efficient and enjoyable. This GitHub Pages-style documentation serves as a testament to the power of automation in simplifying complex tasks and enhancing the creative process. 🌟
