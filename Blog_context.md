I have chosen the topic "AI Art: Creative Expression or Plagiarism?" along with the posts from your blog because it relates to my background as an art student. When I was studying art, one of the essential aspects of my artistic growth was learning from and emulating the work of other artists. This process helped me develop my skills, gain a deeper understanding of different artistic styles, and refine my creative thinking.

The concept of emulating and learning from others is not unique to traditional art education; it also has parallels in the world of artificial intelligence and AI-generated art. The AI machine, like an art student, learns from existing artworks and styles present in its training data. It then generates new art based on this learned knowledge, similar to how I would create art inspired by the artists I admired.

The question of whether AI-generated art is considered plagiarism is intriguing to me because it raises ethical and artistic considerations. As an art student, I always strived to give credit to the artists who inspired me, and I aimed to use their work as a stepping stone for my own creative growth. Similarly, it's important to examine whether AI-generated art should acknowledge its sources and how it blurs the lines between inspiration and imitation.

I wrote a blog on this topic to explore these questions and engage in a thoughtful discussion about the role of AI in the art world. By examining whether AI art is perceived as plagiarism or a legitimate form of creative expression, I aim to contribute to the ongoing conversation about the intersection of technology and art, drawing from my experiences as an art student who once emulated the work of others to grow as an artist.
