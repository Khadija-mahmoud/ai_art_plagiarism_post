# AI Art Creative Expression or Plagiarism?

## Introduction

As the daughter of a mathematics teacher, I have always been driven to excel academically and make my mother proud. Striving to be the best in my class, I dedicated myself to thoroughly understanding subjects and participating in competitions. Despite meeting expectations, I realized the importance of skills like critical thinking and problem-solving, which I admired in others. This recognition led to my fascination with artificial intelligence (AI), a rapidly growing field that enhances everyday life through computer-based intelligence. 

AI is making a big impact in many industries like healthcare, cars, farming, hotels, production, and teaching. It helps businesses work better, cut costs, make customers happier, earn more money, and stay ahead of competitors. In the art world, AI is really changing things. It is making new ways for people and machines to work together in art, bringing new ideas and styles. AI helps artists in practical ways too, like choosing colours or planning their artwork, saving time, and opening up new creative paths.

To really impress people, including my mom, I always engaged in multiple hobbies, ranging from ballet to piano and even visual arts. I consistently incorporated art into all my projects to showcase my talent. In 9th grade, I had a project where I needed to present the cell membrane to my classmates. Biology being my least favourite subject, I often struggled with memorizing and fully understanding these processes. That is when I introduced myself to graphic arts. I would draw the cell structure and organelles as I imagined them, while getting inspiration from online platforms, and studying graphic design. I used Adobe Painting, which is now known as [Adobe Fresco](https://helpx.adobe.com/fresco/using/what-is-adobe-fresco.html), for my graphic art creations. Here are some examples of my self-created graphic art.

Considering I was a 9th grader presenting to other 9th graders a presentation with self-drawn images, everyone was impressed. All because of graphic art. Nowadays AI can easily generate such photos if you ask it to and way better quality. For example, if I were to ask an AI tool known as ChatGPT 4 to generate images explaing the same topics it generates the following images.

Such complex photos! Maybe too detailed for 9th graders. Let’s ask chatGPT4 to simplify it for 9th graders.

Way better then that advanced version and mine. [ChatGPT 4]((https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt)) , developed by OpenAI, is an advanced artificial intelligence language model. It belongs to the GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) series, where '4' denotes its iteration in the series. As a state-of-the-art AI, ChatGPT-4 is characterized by its deep learning algorithms, which are based on a transformer architecture. This allows the model to generate human-like text responses and engage in conversations by predicting subsequent words in a sequence. Now let’s not dive deep into AI art generators without learning about the history of AI art.

## AI Art Generators Concerns 
The issue of plagiarism in AI-generated art is a complex and evolving topic. AI art generators like DALL-E, Midjourney, and others, create artworks based on the vast amounts of data they have been trained on, which includes existing artworks and images. This raises several concerns and questions about originality, copyright, and artistic integrity:

__1.	Training Data and Copyright:__ AI models are trained on large datasets that often include copyrighted artworks and images. When these models generate new artworks, they might produce pieces that are significantly influenced by or closely resemble existing copyrighted works. This raises questions about whether the AI-generated art constitutes a derivative work and if it infringes on the original artist's copyright.

__2.	Originality and Creativity:__ There's a debate about the originality of AI-generated art. Since these artworks are created based on existing styles and images, it's unclear how much creative input is attributed to the AI versus the human user who inputs prompts. This blurs the lines between inspiration and plagiarism.

__3.	Artist Consenty:__ In many cases, artists whose works were used to train these AI models did not give explicit consent for their artworks to be used in this manner. This raises ethical concerns about the use of their creative output without permission or compensation.

__4.	Legal Framework:__ The current legal framework around copyright and intellectual property rights was not designed with AI-generated content in mind. This means there are many grey areas and uncharted territories when it comes to the legalities of AI-generated art, making it difficult to definitively label such works as plagiarism under the law.

__5.	Attribution and Acknowledgement:__ Another issue is the lack of clear attribution in AI-generated art. Since these artworks are often a blend of styles and elements from various sources, it's challenging to acknowledge and credit the original creators.

__6.	Potential for Abuse:__ There is a potential for abuse where individuals could use AI art generators to replicate the style of a specific artist without proper attribution or compensation, effectively creating counterfeit art.

In conclusion, while AI art generators open up new possibilities in the realm of creative expression, they also bring forth significant challenges related to plagiarism and copyright. As the technology evolves, it's likely that legal and ethical guidelines will also need to be updated to address these concerns adequately.
