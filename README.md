# Hi there! 👋

I'm Khadija Mahmoud, a first-semester student studying Health Informatics. 🏥 I've always had a passion for art, and I was a former art student 🎨. Here's a bit about what you'll find on my GitHub:

## 📚 Blog Posts

### AI Art vs. Traditional Art: Does AI Plagiarize Artists?

In [Part One](Part_1.md), I delve into the fascinating world of AI-generated art and explore whether it plagiarizes the work of traditional artists. 🤖🎨

### Image Resizing Automation

I've also written a blog about developing an automation solution for resizing images on my [Blog](https://khadija-mahmoud.github.io/ai_art_plagiarism_post/). Click [here](Automation_Blog/Problem_and_Context.md) to read it and learn how to automate image resizing. 🖼️✨
